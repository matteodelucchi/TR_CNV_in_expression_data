For each biospecimen there exist three RNA seq files:
- blood tissue (healthy)
- solid tissue (healthy)
- primary tumor (not healthy)

For each specimen, all three files are used in one run through the pipeline. 
One run, is executed as one job. 
Therefore, for each specimen a separate job is created. 
This is set up by the file `job_submission_ref_based.sh`:
    for each specimen,
        mkdir specimen_name
        create specimen_name.lsf file
    submit job array to "prod.long" queue
